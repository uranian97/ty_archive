preparing a spreadsheet for insertion into this database:
I have eliminated most of the manul operations that used to be needed. now it is only important that you ensure there are no empty rows at the end of the file.

When this is done, place the spreadsheet in the ./filelists folder

run the filelist.py program 
	python filelist.py <databasename>

now you can type 'update' to add the data to the Filelist folder and generate the metatables
