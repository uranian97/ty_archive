preparing a spreadsheet for insertion into this database:
I have eliminated most of the manual operations that used to be needed. 

When this is done, place the spreadsheet in the ./filelists folder

run the filelist.py program 
	python filelist.py <databasename>

now you can type 'update' to add the data to the Filelist folder and generate the metatables
